This site is a community effort supported by volunteers through the Bytecode Alliance's Special Interest Group for Documentation. 
The **[Bytecode Alliance](https://bytecodealliance.org/)** is a community comprised of many individual contributors and 30+ companies involved in the WebAssembly space. 

The Bytecode Alliance is focused on creating a shared implementation of standards produced by the WebAssembly CG, the WASI Subgroup, and other standardization bodies. We believe that standards are best informed by implementation. To enable this, we bring together a wide range of different use cases. Many of our contributors are also active in standardization and use this implementation experience and feedback to inform their work.

If you would like to get involved, you can find us on the SIG Documentation channel of the [Bytecode Alliance's Zulip server](https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/) or [contribute on the WASI.dev GitHub repo](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasi.dev).
